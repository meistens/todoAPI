Quick documentation;

- 0000/new for posting a task (though it has been made easier to create, delete, edit and update with a button or link).
fyi, that is not the actual port

- database has seeded data, great for testing the update and delete functionalities

- a clean error page when required inputs are omitted without the stacktraces (long, gibberish error lines for non-coders)
